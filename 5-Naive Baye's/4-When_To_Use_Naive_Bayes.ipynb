    "1. **When you want to classify things**\n",

    "   * Example: Decide if an email is spam or not.\n",
    "   * Example: Decide if a review is positive or negative.\n",

    "2. **When your data has clear clues (features)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Example: Words in a message.\n",
    "   * Example: Measurements of something (like height, weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **When speed matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Naive Bayes is very fast compared to many other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **When you don‚Äôt need perfect accuracy but a good simple model**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * It often works surprisingly well even with its ‚Äúnaive‚Äù assumption.\n",

    "### Good fits for Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text problems** (spam filtering, sentiment analysis, topic classification).\n",
    "* **Simple number problems** (predicting categories based on a few measurements).\n",

    "üëâ In short:\n",
    "Use **Naive Bayes** when you need a **fast, simple, and reasonably good** way to sort things into categories, especially with text or when features are simple clues."
