    "### **Regression Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is about **predicting a number** based on some input. Think of it like drawing a line (or curve) that best fits your data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Only **one input variable** predicts one output.\n",
    "   * Example: Predict a student’s score based on **hours studied**.\n",
    "   * Visual: A straight line through a scatter of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Uses **more than one input variable** to predict the output.\n",
    "   * Example: Predict score based on **hours studied** and **hours slept**.\n",
    "   * Visual: A plane or hyperplane through data points in higher dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Polynomial Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The relationship between input and output is **curvy**, not straight.\n",
    "   * Example: Predict growth of a plant where growth speeds up, then slows down.\n",
    "   * Visual: A curve that bends to fit the data instead of a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Underfitting vs Overfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Underfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Model is too **simple** to capture the trend.\n",
    "   * Result: Bad predictions both on old and new data.\n",
    "   * Example: Fitting a straight line to a very wiggly dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Model is too **complex** and memorizes the training data.\n",
    "   * Result: Works perfectly on old data but poorly on new data.\n",
    "   * Example: Drawing a crazy squiggly curve that passes through every training point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Find the **balance** – complex enough to learn patterns but simple enough to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Error Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "These tell us **how good our model is**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Average of the **absolute differences** between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "   * Easy to understand: “On average, our prediction is off by X units.”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Average of **squared differences**.\n",
    "   * Penalizes **big mistakes more** than small ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Square root of MSE.\n",
    "   * Back to the **same units** as the original data, easy to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **R² (R-squared) & Adjusted R²**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **R²**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Shows **how much of the variation** in the data your model explains.\n",
    "   * 1 = perfect fit, 0 = model explains nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adjusted R²**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Like R², but **penalizes unnecessary variables**.\n",
    "   * Useful in multiple regression to check if extra inputs really help.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Summary in One Sentence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple/Multiple/Polynomial Regression: How we draw a line/curve through data.\n",
    "* Underfitting/Overfitting: Too simple vs too complex.\n",
    "* MAE/MSE/RMSE: How wrong our predictions are.\n",
    "* R²/Adjusted R²: How well our model explains the data."
