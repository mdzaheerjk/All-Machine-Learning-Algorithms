    "\n",
    "   * Example: As you study more hours, your exam score first goes up, but after a point, too much study makes you tired and your score goes down. That’s a curve, not a line.\n",

    "2. **The data looks like a curve when you plot it.**\n",

    "   * Example shapes: U-shaped, upside-down U, or a wave-like curve.\n",

    "3. **A straight-line model (simple or multiple linear regression) isn’t good enough.**\n",

    "\n",
    "* Predicting plant growth over time (grows fast, slows down, then stops).\n",
    "* Predicting car speed vs. fuel efficiency (too slow → waste fuel, too fast → waste fuel, sweet spot in the middle).\n",
    "* Predicting learning rate vs. performance (improves, peaks, then declines).\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Not good to use** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The curve is too messy (you might need other models).\n",
    "* You make the polynomial degree too high → the curve wiggles too much and overfits the data."
