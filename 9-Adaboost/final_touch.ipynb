    "## üåü What AdaBoost Does\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost is like a coach who trains a team of weak players (simple models) and makes them work together so they become strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Step by Step)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Equal**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Every training example (data point) is treated as equally important at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Train a Weak Learner**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A very simple model is trained (like a tiny decision tree).\n",
    "   * It makes predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Mistakes**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * See which data points it got wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Increase Focus on Mistakes**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The wrongly predicted points get **more importance**.\n",
    "   * Next learner will try harder on those tricky points.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Train another simple model, again focusing on the errors.\n",
    "   * Do this many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Combine All Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * At the end, all weak models are combined.\n",
    "   * **For classification:** final result is based on a **weighted vote**.\n",
    "   * **For regression:** final result is a **weighted average**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "* Alone, each weak learner is poor.\n",
    "* But together, when each one fixes the previous mistakes, they become powerful.\n",
    "* That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called **‚ÄúBoosting‚Äù** ‚Üí boosting weak models into a strong one."

    "## üîë Important Terms in AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Weak Learner**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A very simple model (like a decision stump).\n",
    "* On its own, it‚Äôs not very accurate.\n",
    "* But many weak learners together make a strong model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Stump**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The simplest weak learner: a decision tree with just **one split, one rule**.\n",
    "* Example: ‚ÄúIs age > 30?‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Weights (for data points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Importance values given to each training example.\n",
    "* At the start: all points are equal.\n",
    "* After each round: wrong points get **higher weight**, so the next learner pays more attention to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Error Rate**\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many mistakes a weak learner makes (considering the weights).\n",
    "* If it‚Äôs good (low error), it gets more say in the final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Alpha (Œ±) = Learner‚Äôs Weight**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A number that shows **how important a weak learner is** in the final model.\n",
    "* If the learner is accurate ‚Üí Œ± is high.\n",
    "* If the learner is weak ‚Üí Œ± is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Boosting**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The process of **combining many weak learners** into one strong model.\n",
    "* Each new learner ‚Äúboosts‚Äù the performance by fixing mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Final Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "* For **classification**: all learners vote, but stronger ones have bigger votes.\n",
    "* For **regression**: all learners‚Äô predictions are averaged, but stronger ones count more.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ That‚Äôs really all you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Weak learner (stump)**\n",
    "* **Weights (on data points)**\n",
    "* **Error rate**\n",
    "* **Alpha (learner importance)**\n",
    "* **Boosting (the combining process)**"
