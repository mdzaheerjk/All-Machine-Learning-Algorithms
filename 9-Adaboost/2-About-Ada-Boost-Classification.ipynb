    "### ðŸŽ¯ Example: Classifying Spam with 2 Weak Learners\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to decide if an email is **Spam (1)** or **Not Spam (0).**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 4 emails:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Email   True Label\n",
    "A       0\n",
    "B       0\n",
    "C       1\n",
    "D       1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Start with Equal Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "Each email is equally important.\n",
    "So weight = 1/4 for A, B, C, D.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Train Weak Learner 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose Weak Learner 1 predicts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A: 0   (correct)\n",
    "B: 1   (wrong)\n",
    "C: 1   (correct)\n",
    "D: 0   (wrong)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It got B and D wrong.\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ AdaBoost increases the weights of **B and D** (so the next learner pays more attention to them).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Train Weak Learner 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, because B and D are \"heavier,\" Weak Learner 2 focuses on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictions of Weak Learner 2:\n",

    "```\n",
    "A: 0   (correct)\n",
    "B: 0   (correct this time âœ…)\n",
    "C: 1   (correct)\n",
    "D: 1   (correct this time âœ…)\n",

    "#### Step 4: Combine the Two Learners\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weak Learner 1 wasnâ€™t great â†’ gets **lower weight** in voting.\n",
    "* Weak Learner 2 was better â†’ gets **higher weight** in voting.\n",

    "### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learner 1 made mistakes.\n",
    "* AdaBoost adjusted importance (B and D got more weight).\n",
    "* Learner 2 fixed those mistakes.\n",
    "* Final combination = strong classifier, even though each learner was weak."
