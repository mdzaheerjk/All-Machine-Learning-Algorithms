    "# 🌟 KNN Algorithm – Simple Steps (with ML wording)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: **Pick K**\n",
    "\n",
    "* K = number of neighbors you will look at.\n",
    "* Example: K = 3 → we’ll check the 3 closest points.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 In ML, **K is a hyperparameter** (something we choose before running the model).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: **Measure Distance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To know who is “closest,” we calculate **distance**.\n",
    "* Most common: **Euclidean distance** (like using a ruler on a graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 In ML, this is the **distance metric**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: **Find K Nearest Neighbors**\n",
    "\n",
    "* From all the points in the dataset, select the **K closest ones** to the new point.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 In ML, we call this **retrieving neighbors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: **Make Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 For **Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Look at the labels of the K neighbors (e.g., Apple 🍎 or Orange 🍊).\n",
    "* The label with the **most votes** becomes the prediction.\n",
    "  👉 In ML: **majority vote rule**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 For **Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Look at the values of the K neighbors (e.g., house prices 💰).\n",
    "* Take the **average (or weighted average)** of those values.\n",
    "  👉 In ML: **averaging rule**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🎯 Putting it Together\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classification with KNN** → Predict the **category** by majority vote.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "# 🧠 Easy Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classification = Asking your neighbors: *“Do you drink tea or coffee?”* → You pick the drink most neighbors prefer.\n",
    "* Regression = Asking your neighbors: *“How much do you spend on coffee per week?”* → You take the average of their answers."

    "* You’re standing at one point in a field.\n",
    "* You want to get to another point.\n",
    "* If you could fly **like a bird**, you’d go in a **straight line**.\n",

    "👉 That straight line is **Euclidean distance**.\n",
    "It’s the “as-the-crow-flies” distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Manhattan Distance (grid distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine you’re in a city with streets laid out like a grid (like Manhattan in New York 🏙️).\n",
    "\n",
    "* You’re at one corner.\n",
    "* You want to get to another corner.\n",
    "* You **can’t cut across buildings**—you must walk along the streets.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 The total number of blocks you walk (up + across) is **Manhattan distance**.\n",

    "### 🌳 KD Tree (K-Dimensional Tree)\n",
    "\n",
    "* It’s a **data structure** that organizes points in space.\n",
    "* It works by **repeatedly splitting the dataset** along one feature at a time (e.g., first split by height, then by weight, etc.).\n",
    "* This creates a tree where each branch represents a smaller region of the data.\n",
    "* During KNN search, you don’t check all points — you only search the **relevant branches** of the tree.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ⚪ Ball Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another **data structure** for organizing points.\n",
    "* Instead of splitting by features, it **groups points into hyperspheres** (think “balls” around clusters of points).\n",
    "* Each ball contains points that are close to each other.\n",
    "* During KNN search, you can quickly eliminate balls that are too far away, so you only check the useful ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🔑 Why are they important in ML?\n",
    "\n",
    "* KNN requires finding **nearest neighbors**, which can be slow if you check every point.\n",

    "✅ **Summary in ML terms (simple)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **KD Tree** → splits space by features (best for low dimensions).\n",
    "* **Ball Tree** → groups points into balls (better for high dimensions).\n",
