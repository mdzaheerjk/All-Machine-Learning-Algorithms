    "### What is KNN Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of **KNN Classifier** as “choosing a category” (cat 🐱 or dog 🐶).\n",
    "But **KNN Regressor** is about “predicting a number” (like weight, price, or temperature 🌡️).\n",
    "\n",
    "It works the same way: look at the nearest neighbors, then instead of voting, it **averages their numbers**.\n",
    "\n",

    "### When should you use KNN Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use KNN Regressor when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You want to predict a number, not a label**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Example: Predicting the **price of a house** 🏠 instead of saying “cheap/expensive.”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nearby things tend to have similar values**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Example: Houses in the same neighborhood often cost about the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **You don’t need super fast predictions on huge data**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Because KNN checks neighbors every time, it can get slow on very big datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **You want something simple and easy to understand**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * KNN is beginner-friendly because it doesn’t require complex math or training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to predict the **price of a new house**.\n",
    "You already know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* House A: 2 bedrooms → \\$200k\n",
    "* House B: 3 bedrooms → \\$250k\n",
    "* House C: 4 bedrooms → \\$300k\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a new house has 3 bedrooms.\n",
    "KNN Regressor looks at the “nearest” houses (say, B and C) and averages their prices → around **\\$275k**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 In short:\n",
    "Use **KNN Classifier** when the answer is a **category**.\n",
    "Use **KNN Regressor** when the answer is a **number**."
