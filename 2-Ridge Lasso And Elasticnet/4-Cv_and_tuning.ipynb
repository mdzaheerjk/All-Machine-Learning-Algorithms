    "# Types of Cross validations\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 1. Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Imagine you have **10 questions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train the model on 9 questions, test it on the **1 question left out**.\n",
    "* Repeat this 10 times, each time leaving out a different question.\n",
    "* Average the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Very thorough (uses almost all data for training).\n",
    "❌ But can be slow if you have a lot of data, because it repeats many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 2. Leave-P-Out Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Similar to LOOCV, but instead of leaving **1 question out**, you leave out **P questions** at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: With 10 questions, leave out 2 each time.\n",
    "* Train on 8, test on 2 → repeat for all possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ More flexible than LOOCV.\n",
    "❌ Gets very expensive if P is big or dataset is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 3. K-Fold Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 The most common one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split your data into **k equal groups** (say 5 groups).\n",
    "* Train on 4 groups, test on the 1 left out.\n",
    "* Repeat until every group has been tested once.\n",
    "* Average the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Balanced, efficient, widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 4. Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Same as K-Fold, but with a twist:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Useful when your data has **categories** (like 70% cats, 30% dogs).\n",
    "* It makes sure **each fold keeps the same ratio** of cats and dogs.\n",
    "* This prevents some folds from being “unbalanced” (e.g., one fold with mostly cats).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Best for classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 5. Time Series Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Special for **time-based data** (like stock prices, weather, sales).\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can’t shuffle time, because the past always comes before the future.\n",
    "* Instead, you train on earlier data and test on later data.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Train on Jan–Mar, test on Apr\n",
    "  * Train on Jan–Apr, test on May\n",
    "  * Train on Jan–May, test on Jun\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Respects the order of time.\n",
    "❌ Can’t randomly split like K-Fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LOOCV** → leave 1 out each time.\n",
    "* **Leave-P-Out** → leave P out each time.\n",
    "* **K-Fold** → split into k groups.\n",
    "* **Stratified K-Fold** → like K-Fold but keeps category balance.\n",
    "* **Time Series CV** → train on past, test on future."

    "\n",
    "👉 That’s why in ML, cross-validation is the standard way to check if a model is **learning true patterns** in the data rather than just **memorizing a single train-test split**."

    "# Most Commonly used hyperparameter tuning techniques\n",

    "* The algorithm tries **every possible combination** and checks which one works best.\n",

    "* **Cons:** Can be very slow if you have many hyperparameters or many values.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 2. Random Search\n",

    "* **How it works:** Instead of trying all combinations, it **randomly picks some combinations** to test.\n",
