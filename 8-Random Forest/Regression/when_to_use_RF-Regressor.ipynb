    "### 🌳 Random Forest Regressor\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s just like the **Random Forest Classifier**, but instead of predicting categories (like *Yes/No, Spam/Not Spam*), it predicts **continuous values** (like house price, temperature, or sales numbers).\n",

    "### ✅ When to use Random Forest Regressor\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You want to predict numbers (not categories).**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Example: predicting house prices, car mileage, or sales revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Your dataset has many features.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * It can handle both numerical and categorical features well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **You want accuracy without lots of parameter tuning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * It usually gives good results straight away.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **You’re worried about overfitting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A single decision tree might memorize the data (too specific).\n",
    "   * Random Forest averages many trees → predictions are more stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **You want to know feature importance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * It tells you which features (e.g., “number of rooms” or “location”) matter most for the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 Small Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you want to predict house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You train 10 decision trees on different random samples.\n",
    "* For a new house:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Tree 1 predicts **\\$200k**\n",
    "  * Tree 2 predicts **\\$210k**\n",
    "  * Tree 3 predicts **\\$220k**\n",
    "  * …\n",
    "* Final Random Forest prediction = **average of all trees** (e.g., \\$210k).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 In ML terms (without jargon):\n",
    "The **Random Forest Regressor** is great when you need a **stable, accurate prediction for numbers** and don’t want to spend too much time fine-tuning.\n"
