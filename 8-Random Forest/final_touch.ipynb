    "### 🌳 What is Random Forest?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Random Forest** is like a **team of Decision Trees** working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A single decision tree can make predictions, but it might **overfit** (memorize training data too much).\n",
    "* A Random Forest builds **many decision trees** on random parts of the data and then **combines their answers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s called a “forest” because it’s just a **collection of many trees**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ How it works (step by step)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Take the dataset**\n",
    "   Example: Predict if a customer will buy a product based on **Age**, **Income**, and **Location**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make random samples**\n",
    "   Randomly pick rows from the dataset to create different training sets (with replacement).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Grow multiple trees**\n",
    "   Train a decision tree on each random dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Tree 1 might say “Yes” based on Age.\n",
    "   * Tree 2 might say “No” based on Income.\n",
    "   * Tree 3 might say “Yes” based on Location.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Make a prediction**\n",
    "   When a new customer comes in:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Each tree gives its prediction.\n",
    "   * The forest combines them:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **For classification** → majority vote (e.g., 7 trees say “Yes,” 3 say “No” → final = “Yes”).\n",
    "     * **For regression** → average of all predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 Small Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict house prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tree 1 → \\$200k\n",
    "* Tree 2 → \\$220k\n",
    "* Tree 3 → \\$210k\n",
    "  **Final prediction = average = \\$210k**\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict if an email is spam:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tree 1 → Spam\n",
    "* Tree 2 → Not Spam\n",
    "* Tree 3 → Spam\n",
    "  **Final prediction = Spam (majority vote)**\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔑 In ML terms (still simple):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random Forest = **ensemble of decision trees**.\n",
    "* Built using **bagging** (random subsets + multiple models).\n",
    "* **Strong points:** Accurate, handles many features, reduces overfitting, works well for both classification and regression.\n",
    "* **Weak points:** Can be slower with very large datasets, less interpretable than a single tree.\n",

    "### 🌱 Base Learner\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **base learner** is the starting model we use in an ensemble.\n",
    "* It can be **any ML algorithm**: a decision tree, logistic regression, SVM, etc.\n",
    "* Example: In a Random Forest, the **base learner** is a **decision tree**.\n",

    "Think of it as the **building block** of an ensemble.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌱 Weak Learner\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **weak learner** is a simple model that performs **just slightly better than random guessing**.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For classification with 2 classes → better than 50% accuracy.\n",
    "  * For regression → explains a little bit of the data pattern, but not perfectly.\n",
    "* In Boosting, we often use **very shallow decision trees (stumps)** as weak learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a **tiny model that alone isn’t strong**, but when combined with others, it becomes powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we’re predicting if an email is spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Base learner:** Decision Tree.\n",
    "* If the tree is very deep → it may be strong.\n",
    "* If the tree is very shallow (only 1 or 2 splits) → it’s a **weak learner**.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * Dataset has 1,000 rows.\n",
    "  * For one tree in a Random Forest, we randomly pick 700 rows (with replacement).\n",
    "  * Each tree gets a slightly different dataset.\n",

    "* Also called **column sampling**.\n",
    "* Means: instead of using **all features** (columns), the model only looks at a **random subset of features** when splitting nodes.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Dataset has 10 features (age, income, location, etc.).\n",
    "  * For a split in one tree, the algorithm randomly picks only 3 features to consider.\n",

    "* At a split, the algorithm might randomly choose \\[Age, Age, Income].\n",
