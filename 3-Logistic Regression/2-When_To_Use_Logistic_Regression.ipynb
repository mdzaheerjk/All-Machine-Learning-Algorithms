    "# ✅ Use Logistic Regression when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Your outcome is yes/no**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Example: Will a customer buy (Yes/No)?\n",
    "   * Example: Is this email spam (Yes/No)?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **You want probabilities, not just labels**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Logistic regression doesn’t just say *Yes* or *No*.\n",
    "   * It gives a probability, like: “This email is **80% chance spam**.”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The relationship is roughly straight-line-ish**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If increasing “study hours” usually increases the chance of “pass exam,” logistic regression works well.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **You want something simple and explainable**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * You can look at the model and say:\n",
    "     “If income goes up, the chance of buying goes up by this much.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Don’t use Logistic Regression when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need to predict numbers (like house prices).\n",
    "* The outcome has **many categories** (like “cat/dog/bird”) → then use multinomial logistic regression or OVR Regression Model.\n",
    "* Relationships are super complex and messy (then tree-based or neural nets may work better).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 In short:\n",
    "Use logistic regression when you want a **simple, explainable model** for a **yes/no problem** and you also want to know the **probabilities**.\n"
